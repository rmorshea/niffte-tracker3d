###3-D Trajectory Generation in Hexagonal Geometry
#####author: Ryan Morshead  
Groups discrete data events into directional trajectories in a 3-D space.
Based on Neutron Induced Fission Fragment Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE) time projection chamber data.
This is C++ interpretation of:

for later integration into the ROOT framework implamented by NIFFTE.
